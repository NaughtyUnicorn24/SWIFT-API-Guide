# API Specification

Each API must be defined in the [OpenAPI Specification (OAS) version 3](https://swagger.io/docs/specification).

The API specification must be created in [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com).

Currently, SWIFT uses the Cloud version of SwaggerHub, but in the future an On-Premises version of SwaggerHub will be available.

Once the API specification is published in SwaggerHub, it must be made available on the [SWIFT Developer Portal](https://developer.swift.com).

The OAS document describes all resources and their associated operations (CRUD).

The OpenAPI Specification version 3 is defined in [GitHub](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md).
